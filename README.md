Modular Game Engine Project

Built for Mingw, will need to modify the Makefile slightly to build on other platforms e.g. replace CC = mingw32-g++ with CC = g++ for linux or mac and alter the delete section with the unix equivalent command.

# Build instructions
Build the libraries mentioned in the make file and set the required enviroment variables then run make.
